# Neural-Network-CIFAR10
Implement from scratch the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm in order to classify a given image into one of 10 classes, using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class. The dataset has 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
